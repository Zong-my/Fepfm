## üìò Overview

The Fepfm framework provides trustworthy machine learning for predicting post-disturbance frequency extremes (nadir/zenith) and their arrival times in modern power systems. Implemented in Python with support for sklearn and leading GBDT libraries, Fepfm enables high-accuracy, low-latency prediction across diverse grid scenarios by integrating:
- Automated large-scale dataset generation through PSS/E to address real-world data scarcity.
- An adaptive feature selection algorithm (Fepfm-AdaSelector) that fuses power system physical insights with multi-model SHAP analysis.
- Optuna-optimized LightGBM and CatBoost models for efficient hyperparameter tuning and superior generalization.
- A multi-scale temporal input strategy to capture transient and long-term frequency dynamics.

The framework has been validated on modified IEEE 39-bus and 300-bus systems, achieving over 95% accuracy (1‚ÄìMAPE) with sub-millisecond inference latency, making it highly applicable to real-time dynamic security assessment in low-inertia, RES-rich power systems.

## üöÄ Usage
### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory. Replace `my-project` with your preferred folder name:


     git clone https://github.com/Zong-my/Fepfm.git my-project
     cd my-project

### Running the Code
Execute the main script ./utils/main.py to try the Fepfm framework. You first need to construct your own dataset using Python and PSSE software. The co-usage methodology of Python and PSSE can be referred to at the following URL: https://github.com/Zong-my/psse3304_python_tutorial
